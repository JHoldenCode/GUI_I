            This next section contains an excerpt about my experience running throughout highschool
            and also a table below it that shows my fastest times across a variety of different

        <h1>My Experience with the Sport</h1>
        <p>
            I ran Cross Country and Track & Field throughout all four years that I was in highschool.<br></br>
            I improved each season, recording faster and faster times in a variety of races. This continued<br></br>
            until the spring season of my 4<sup>th</sup> year in highschool when the season was cancelled<br></br>
            due to COVID-19. This was a heartbreaking way to end the year, but everybody was still able to <br></br>
            cherish and appreciate the time we had before quarantine. Below you can find some of my PR's<br></br>
            (personal records) in different events.
